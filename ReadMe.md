## Deploy and run steps
1. Use maven plugin(package demand) or just use export war method to export the war package.
2. Copy the .war file to all the tomcat webapp folder.
3. Use terminal to run the redis in the /opt/redis/src folder redis-server file. Run under default port on default.
4. Run all the tomcat under/opt/, use/apache-tomcat/bin, sh startup.sh.
5. Run the ngnix under/usr/local/nginx/sbin/. Use ./nginx to run.
6. Browser http://localhost/ShiroTest to browse it. Since the Ngnix is running under 80 port by default.
   </br>So if the 80 port is used by other server such as Apache, it will goes wrong. Nginx can be used as the http server only.

## What's new in version 2.0
1. Change the environment to SpringBoot.
2. Use Java config instead of xml config.
3. Use log4j2 instead of logback as the default logging system.
4. Create two Branches. One is using Spring session and redis to control authentication. Another is using JWT.
   </br>All of them can be used in Cloud environment. Haven't decided to use which version.

## Future features
1. Change authentication from username, password to JWT. In order to the next phrase.(Merge to SpringCloud).
2. Use WebSocket to notify token expired.
3. Split current Jar to certain SpringCloud micro-services(With business requirement). And use rest method to communicate with each parts.
   </br>(Haven't decided using restTemplate or Feign).
